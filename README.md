# Extended Medallion Architecture (Lakehouse ETL)

This project ingests and processes NYC taxi trip data through layered transformations that progressively enforce schema validation, data quality checks, and business-driven logic. Designed with production-oriented principles such as idempotent transformations, clear layer isolation, and analytics-ready structuring, the pipeline establishes a reliable foundation for downstream business intelligence and future machine learning workloads.

## Implemented Layers

### 🔹 Raw Layer
- Immutable ingestion from external sources (NYC TLC green taxi data)
- Partitioned by year
- No transformations applied
- Acts as the system of record

### 🔹 Bronze Layer
- Schema enforcement
- Data type standardization
- Basic validation checks
- Minimal transformation while preserving source granularity

### 🔹 Silver Layer
- Business-rule filtering
- Deduplication
- Feature engineering (e.g., trip duration, fare per mile)
- Join-ready, analytics-optimized datasets

---

## Upcoming Layers

### 🔸 Gold Layer (Planned)
- Aggregated business metrics
- Star-schema dimensional modeling
- Dashboard-ready fact and dimension tables

### 🔸 Platinum Layer (Planned)
- Machine learning feature engineering
- Vector embeddings
- Model training datasets
